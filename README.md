## How to participate

1. **Fork this repository** to your personal account or organization (**Fork â†’ Create a fork**).  
2. Work in your fork; we recommend a branch named `feature/solution`.  
3. **When youâ€™re done**, open a **Pull Request (PR)** from your branch to `main` in *your own fork*.  
   - Leave the PR **open and unmerged** so we can review commits, diffs, and comments.  
4. Invite `@hemnys` as a *reviewer* or *collaborator* so we have access to your PR.

### Shopify Functions and Checkout UI Extensions â€” **explicit requirements**

| What you must do | Why |
|------------------|-----|
| **Create two separate private repositories** under your account: <br>â€¢ `bundle-function` (CartTransform) <br>â€¢ `bundle-checkout-extension` | Keeps code that may require secrets or CI isolated. |
| Develop each component (Function and Extension) in its respective repo, following Git best practices. | Allows version control and review per module. |
| **Open a PR to `main`** in **each** of those repositories and keep it open. | We need to review implementation, tests, and docs for both modules. |
| Add **direct links** to each PR in the README of your fork. | Centralizes navigation for the evaluation team. |

> **Functions or Extensions housed only inside the main fork without dedicated PRs will not be accepted.**
